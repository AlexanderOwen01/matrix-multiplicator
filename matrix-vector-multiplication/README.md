# Matrix and Vector Multiplication


The command used in the new terminal is:

```
wsl 
```
After that, these are the code execution: 

```
- make run
- make clear
- make time
- make space
```
 
 # Time complexity:
 
To run the time complexity, the code that is used is: 

```
make time
```
This  command will print out how long it takes for the program to run. 


# Space complexity

To run the space complexity, the code that is used in the wsl is: 

```
make space
```

The code executed here show you to input the value of N. Here, I use N starting from N = 200. And then, the files are executed 4 more times each with different input values, which the values increase 200 everytime.
